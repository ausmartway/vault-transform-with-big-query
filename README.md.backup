### Components

1. **Cloud Function**: Python function handling BigQuery remote function calls
2. **BigQuery Remote Functions**: SQL functions that call the Cloud Function  
3. **HCP Vault Transform Engine**: Format-preserving encryption/decryption
4. **Sample Dataset**: Fraud detection data with encrypted credit cards

## Features

- ✅ **Format-Preserving Encryption**: Credit card numbers remain 16 digits
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Deployed to Google Cloud Platform
- ✅ **Zero Trust**: All data encrypted at application layer
- ✅ **SQL Transparent**: Use encryption/decryption in BigQuery SQL queries
- ✅ **Secure**: HCP Vault managed encryption keys and policies
- ✅ **Scalable**: Cloud Function auto-scales based on BigQuery demand

## Prerequisites

### Required Services
- **Google Cloud Platform** account with billing enabled
- **HCP Vault** (Standard/Plus tier for Transform engine)
- **Project Owner/Editor** role in GCP
- **BigQuery Admin** permissions

### Required Tools
- `gcloud` CLI (Google Cloud SDK)
- `bq` CLI (BigQuery command-line tool)
- `python3` with pip

### Environment Variables
```bash
export PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
export VAULT_ADDR=https://your-hcp-vault.vault.aws.hashicorp.cloud:8200
export VAULT_TOKEN=your-hcp-vault-token
export VAULT_ROLE=creditcard-transform
export VAULT_TRANSFORMATION=creditcard-fpe
```

⚠️ **Important**: Must use HCP Vault or cloud-accessible Vault (not localhost)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Encryption/Decryption
```sql
-- Encrypt credit card number
SELECT vault_functions.encrypt_credit_card('4111111111111111') as encrypted_card;

-- Decrypt encrypted value  
SELECT vault_functions.decrypt_credit_card('3003078876416946') as original_card;
```

### Query Encrypted Data
```sql
-- Find all transactions for a specific credit card
SELECT 
    transaction_id,
    amount, 
    merchant,
    is_fraud
FROM `your-project.fraud_detection.transactions` 
WHERE encrypted_credit_card = vault_functions.encrypt_credit_card('4111111111111111');
```

### Encrypt Existing Data
```sql
-- Encrypt existing plaintext credit card data
UPDATE `your-project.fraud_detection.transactions`
SET encrypted_credit_card = vault_functions.encrypt_credit_card(credit_card_number)
WHERE encrypted_credit_card IS NULL;
```

Transactions are sent to Vault Transform Secret Engine, which encrypts the data.

As an Operator, I want to be able to query the encrypted data in BigQuery without needing to decrypt it first, so that I can analyze the data more efficiently. I can use original credit card numbers as part of my queries. BigQuery will first call Vault transform API to encrypt the orginal credit card number, which will then be used to query the database, then decrypt the result and show the transactions to the Operator allowing me to decide whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

## solution

The solution is to create a custom BigQuery function that integrates with the Hashicorp Vault Transform Secret Engine. This function will handle the encryption and decryption of sensitive data, allowing Operators to query encrypted data directly in BigQuery without needing to manually decrypt it.

The function should be hosted on Google Cloud Functions, which will allow it to be easily accessible from BigQuery. The function will take the original credit card number as input, call the Vault Transform Secret Engine API to encrypt it, and return the encrypted value. When querying the database, BigQuery will use this function to encrypt the credit card number before executing the query.

When retrieving results, the function will also handle decryption of the data returned from BigQuery, allowing Operators to view the original credit card numbers in a secure manner.

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Vault Configuration

You have multiple options to configure your Vault Transform Secret Engine:

> **Note**: This implementation uses a custom FPE (Format Preserving Encryption) transformation specifically designed for credit card numbers, providing secure encryption while maintaining the original format structure.

##### Option A: Use the automated setup script (Recommended)

```bash
# Make the script executable and run it
chmod +x setup_vault.sh
./setup_vault.sh
```

##### Option B: Manual setup using Vault CLI commands

```bash
# Enable Transform Secret Engine
vault secrets enable transform

# Create alphabet for numeric characters
vault write transform/alphabet/numeric alphabet="0123456789"

# Create template for credit card format
vault write transform/template/creditcard \
  type=regex \
  pattern="(\d{4})-?(\d{4})-?(\d{4})-?(\d{4})" \
  alphabet=numeric

# Create FPE transformation
vault write transform/transformation/creditcard-fpe \
  type=fpe \
  template=creditcard \
  tweak_source=internal \
  allowed_roles=creditcard-transform

# Create role using our custom transformation
vault write transform/role/creditcard-transform \
  transformations=creditcard-fpe

# Create policy and token
vault policy write transform-policy transform-policy.hcl
vault token create -policy=transform-policy
```

##### Option C: Use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code

```bash
# Initialize and apply Terraform configuration
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

#### 2. Deploy Cloud Function

Update the variables in `deploy.sh` with your actual values:

```bash
# Edit deploy.sh with your project details
PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
VAULT_URL="https://your-vault-instance.com"
VAULT_TOKEN="your-vault-token"

# Make script executable and deploy
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

#### 3. Create BigQuery Connection

Create a connection to your Cloud Function in BigQuery:

```sql
-- Create connection for remote functions
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL CONNECTION `your-project-id.your-region.vault-connection`
OPTIONS (
  type = 'CLOUD_RESOURCE',
  endpoint = 'https://your-cloud-function-url'
);
```

#### 4. Set Up BigQuery Remote Functions

Run the SQL commands in `bigquery_setup.sql` to create the remote functions in BigQuery.

## Local Development Environment

# Check service status
./scripts/manage.sh status

# Run interactive query tool
./scripts/manage.sh interactive

# Run comprehensive demo

./scripts/manage.sh stop
```

### Services Included

- **Vault**: HashiCorp Vault with Transform Secret Engine (port 8200)

For detailed documentation on querying encrypted data, see [`docs/encrypted_queries.md`](docs/encrypted_queries.md).

### Usage Examples

#### Query with Original Credit Card Number

```sql
-- Find transactions for a specific credit card
SELECT 
  transaction_id,
  vault_functions.decrypt_credit_card(encrypted_credit_card) as credit_card_number,
  amount,
  transaction_date,
  merchant_name
FROM `fraud_detection.transactions`
WHERE encrypted_credit_card = vault_functions.encrypt_credit_card('4111111111111111')
ORDER BY transaction_date DESC;
```

#### Fraud Detection Analysis

```sql
-- Analyze suspicious patterns
SELECT 
  vault_functions.decrypt_credit_card(encrypted_credit_card) as credit_card_number,
  merchant_name,
  COUNT(*) as suspicious_transactions,
  SUM(amount) as total_amount
FROM `fraud_detection.transactions`
WHERE 
  amount > 1000
  AND transaction_date >= CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY encrypted_credit_card, merchant_name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
ORDER BY suspicious_transactions DESC;
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Vault Token Management**: Use Vault's auth methods (e.g., GCP auth) instead of static tokens in production
2. **Network Security**: Ensure secure communication between Cloud Function and Vault
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper IAM policies for BigQuery and Cloud Functions
4. **Audit Logging**: Enable audit logging for both Vault and BigQuery operations
5. **Key Rotation**: Implement regular rotation of Vault tokens and encryption keys

### Monitoring and Logging

- Cloud Function logs are available in Google Cloud Logging
- Vault audit logs track all encryption/decryption operations
- BigQuery job logs show remote function usage
- Set up alerts for failed operations or unusual patterns

### Testing

Run the unit tests to verify the implementation:

```bash
python -m pytest test_main.py -v
```

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Vault Connection Issues**: Verify network connectivity and authentication
2. **BigQuery Remote Function Errors**: Check Cloud Function logs and IAM permissions
3. **Performance Issues**: Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper retry logic and rate limiting

This solution provides a robust, secure, and scalable way for operators to work with encrypted credit card data in BigQuery while maintaining the security benefits of Vault Transform Secret Engine.
